# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CNN-based-Classifier

This is a simple CNN based multiclass classifier trained on a Kaggle dataset with two Convolutional layer and one fully connected linear layer.
This is one my first tensorflow projects. Accuracy was over 85%. The accuracy is high due to the low volume of the dataset.
